Each value of `targets` block as defined below.
    (Required) `lambda_function` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target Lambda. If your ARN does not specify a version or alias, the latest version ($LATEST) will be used by default. ARNs that specify a version / alias do so after the function name, and are separated by a colon.

    (Optional) `enabled` - Whether health checks are enabled. Health checks count as a request for your Lambda function. Defaults to `false`.
    (Optional) `healthy_threshold` - The number of consecutive health checks successes required before considering an unhealthy target healthy. Valid value range is 2 - 10. Defaults to `5`.
    (Optional) `unhealthy_threshold` - The number of consecutive health check failures required before considering a target unhealthy. Valid value range is 2 - 10. Defaults to `2`.
    (Optional) `interval` - Approximate amount of time, in seconds, between health checks of an individual target. Valid value range is 5 - 300. Defaults to `35`.
    (Optional) `timeout` - The amount of time, in seconds, during which no response means a failed health check. Valid value range is 2 - 120. Defaults to `30`.
    (Optional) `success_codes` - The HTTP codes to use when checking for a successful response from a target. You can specify multiple values (for example, `200,202`) or a range of values (for example, `200-299`). Defaults to `200`.
    (Optional) `path` - Use the default path of `/` to ping the root, or specify a custom path if preferred.
