    (Optional) `interval` - Approximate amount of time, in seconds, between health checks of an individual target. Valid value range is 5 - 300. Defaults to `10`.
    (Optional) `timeout` - The amount of time, in seconds, during which no response means a failed health check. Valid value range is 2 - 120. Defaults to `6` when the `protocol` is `HTTP`, and `10` when the `protocol` is `HTTPS`.
    (Optional) `path` - Use the default path of `/` to ping the root, or specify a custom path if preferred. Only valid if the `protocol` is `HTTP` or `HTTPS`.
